The previous AI engineer focused on transforming a basic Chrome extension into a medical-grade annotation system. Initial efforts involved integrating IndexedDB for robust image storage and implementing core annotation and capture functionalities. The development trajectory was heavily iterative, driven by user feedback and bug reports, notably around PDF export issues.

Key challenges addressed included resolving red dot coordinate inaccuracies, ensuring dashed line visibility, and comprehensive memory management. Despite several attempts, persistent issues with Chrome storage quota during PDF export and subsequent IndexedDB object store errors plagued the development. The engineer implemented a manual console command () as a workaround for schema issues, which worked during internal testing but prompted the user to request an automatic fix. The current work centers on this automation, aiming to make the IndexedDB schema repair seamless upon extension popup opening.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to develop a medical-grade screenshot annotation Chrome extension providing precise tools and a seamless workflow. Core requirements include:
-   **Annotation & Workflow**: Enable clear annotations, auto-start annotation post-capture, and direct click-to-annotate.
-   **Precision**: Ensure pinpoint markers, draggable text, and 360-degree adjustable arrows for accurate linking, with no coordinate offset (specifically 0.25-inch offset in PDF export).
-   **Compatibility**: Universal functionality across all webpages, including restricted Chrome internal and  pages.
-   **Timestamping**: Automatic date/time stamps on captured images.
-   **PDF Export**: Export 100% quality, timestamped, annotated images into a borderless PDF journal, capable of handling unlimited data without Chrome storage limitations.
-   **Bug Resolution**: Address manifest errors, blank PDF screens, image compression (ensure 100% quality), storage quota issues, and coordinate precision.
-   **Debug & Persistence**: Maintain popup state, ensure debug log continuity across captures and annotations, and implement robust memory management.
The current state includes unlimited storage via IndexedDB for general screenshots and annotations, with a recent fix redirecting large PDF export data to IndexedDB. The primary remaining task is to automate the IndexedDB schema repair for PDF export.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on fulfilling the user's explicit request to automate the IndexedDB schema repair process. The user expressed frustration with recurring object store not found errors during PDF export and demanded that the  command, previously a manual console command workaround, be automatically executed upon the extension's popup opening.

The engineer confirmed understanding this critical need and has begun implementing this automatic healing system. This involves modifying  to incorporate the logic that checks the IndexedDB schema integrity and performs the  if necessary, without requiring any user intervention. The very last message indicates the engineer is currently adding the necessary automatic schema repair notification to the popup initialization, suggesting the core repair logic might be in place, and the final steps involve integrating it smoothly into the popup's lifecycle and providing appropriate user feedback during the auto-repair.
