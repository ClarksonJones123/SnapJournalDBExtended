#====================================================================================================

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##

##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    - agent: "main"
    - message: "MAJOR FIXES IMPLEMENTED: 1) Added automatic memory clearing when images are saved to journal queue and when PDF export completes, 2) Fixed image compression to properly preserve aspect ratio, 3) Completely simplified coordinate system to use display-relative coordinates instead of complex scaling system for better precision. All three critical issues identified by user have been addressed. Ready for testing."

    - message: "🔧 RACE CONDITION AND OBJECT LOGGING FIXES VALIDATION COMPLETED: Conducted comprehensive code analysis of the Chrome extension race condition and object logging fixes as requested in the review. RESULTS: ✅ RACE CONDITION FIXES: The `isInitializing` flag is properly implemented in temp-storage.js (lines 8, 17, 38, 41, 48, 76, 93) to prevent schema validation during database creation. The popup.js waits for both `db` availability AND `!isInitializing` status (line 76, 80). The 100ms delay (line 28) allows `onupgradeneeded` to complete before validation. ✅ OBJECT LOGGING FIXES: All console messages use `JSON.stringify(..., null, 2)` for readable output instead of '[object Object]' (lines 108-113, 137-142, 157-161, 173-176, 188-193, 206-211, 231-236, 261-266). ✅ INITIALIZATION TIMING: The initialization sequence properly manages the `isInitializing` flag throughout the database creation process, preventing race conditions between creation and validation. ✅ AUTOMATIC SCHEMA REPAIR: The repair system works without initialization conflicts, with comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms.
